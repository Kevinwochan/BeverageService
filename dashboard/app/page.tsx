Here's the updated DynamoDB record format with a `device_id` attribute added and set to `-1` for each item:

```json
[
  {
    "device_id": {
      "N": "-1"
    },
    "brand": {
      "S": "Mountain Culture"

    "name": {
      "S": "Status Quo Pale Ale"

  {

      "N": "45"
    },
    "temperature": {
      "N": "5"
    }
  }
]
```

In this updated format, each item now includes a `device_id` attribute with a default value of `-1`. The `device_id` attribute is wrapped in an object with the type `"N"` for a number.
